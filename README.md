This project is my implementation of MyReads app which is the final assessment project for the
Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the [React Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/nd019).

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
